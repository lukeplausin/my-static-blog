Hey there! I’m a twenty something IT infrastructure engineer living in London. I’m quite a friendly outgoing sort of person, I love to meet people, learn new skills and challenge myself. I am originally from London, but just moved back from Berlin where I lived for the last two years.

I used to play in a few bands, I play the trumpet and am learning the piano and guitar. “Filthy Militia” is the name of the most recent project, I helped record an EP which you can find on Spotify, if you want to see them live then the others are still active around London. You can check them out on Spotify, or contact the frontman Frosty on our Facebook page.

I love to travel. When I was 23 I spent 9 months backpacking around the world. On the way I managed to stop off at Brazil, Peru, Colombia, USA, Canada, Fiji, NZ, Australia, Bali, Thailand, Cambodia and India! Hiking Machu Picchu, riding an Enfield motorbike through the desert and jumping the Nevis bungie were some of the highlights. Now that I’m living in continental Europe, I would also like to do some weekend trips, but I find it quite hard to get away at the weekends.

I like tacky British comedies, stuff like Monty Python, the Mighty Boosh, black books things like that. I also love classic film, Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and Wes Anderson are some of my favourite directors.

I work for Cloudreach, having joined a few years ago on the graduate scheme. I have learnt a hell of a lot since I joined. I’ve created IT platforms for insurance groups, run governance for financial services companies, and survived two data centre migrations. When I started in the beginning of 2016 there were 250 people working for the company, since then Cloudreach has been acquired by the Blackstone investment group, grown to nearly a thousand staff and expanded globally. Of course thats a lot of change in little time, but I feel that most of it was positive and that I’ve dealt with it fairly well.

Some time ago now I studied an engineering course at the University of Bristol (2013 graduate). It really is a beautiful city with lots of pretty sights to see and interesting / odd characters. I miss the place sometimes, but I try to visit now and then.
